# Visualization-Report-on-African-Wars
I chose to do this topic because I thought it is important to bring awareness to this issue and focus specifically on Nigeria not only because I am from there, but also because it has the highest rate of violence among the west African countries. I hope this visualization will help to put the spotlight on a different part of the world and bring awareness to somethings that are going on there. 

# Dataset
The dataset is about the different violence that took place in different parts of Africa from 2019 – 2022. I got the data from [here](https://acleddata.com/data-export-tool/). The original dataset has 31 columns in total and a total of 19579 data entry for each column. 


# Visualisation
These are the visualisations I produced to from the using the dataset:

# Discovery from explored data
•	The history behind violence in countries, is that the citizen ends up suffering the most.
•	Some countries in west Africa are Mali, Nigeria, Niger, Guinea, Liberia, Senegal, Mauritania, Ghana, Ivory Coast, Sierra Leone, Togo and Cape Verde 
•	Between the four years (2019 -2022), 2020 was the worst for violence in west Africa (refer to bar chat). I agree with this because the endsars movement took place in 2020 in Nigeria.
•	The dataset had a total of 19579 rows of data for each column and there were 31 columns.
•	Most of the column types were character.
•	The biggest event was violence against the citizens in west Africa and it is mainly caused by military personnel’s, police etc basically people in power.
•	Nigeria has the highest occurrence of these events.
