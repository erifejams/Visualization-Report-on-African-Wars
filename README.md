# Visualization-Report-on-African-Wars
This is a visualisation report done in R of different violence that took place in west africa. I chose to do this topic because I thought it is important to bring awareness to this issue and focus specifically on Nigeria not only because I am from there, but also because it has the highest rate of violence among the west African countries. I hope this visualization will help to put the spotlight on a different part of the world and bring awareness to somethings that are going on there. 

<em>More details can be found in the visualisation report.</em>

# Dataset
The dataset is about the different violence that took place in different parts of Africa from 2019 – 2022. I got the data from [here](https://acleddata.com/data-export-tool/). The original dataset has 31 columns in total and a total of 19579 data entry for each column. 


# Steps I took to explore the data
- I reduced the data so that it only displayed the data from west african countries.
- I removed the missing values from the data.
- I changed the data points(latitute and longitude) to numeric.
- I dropped columns that were not needed.
- I removed duplicate rows.

By the **bold end of the data exploaration** there were 200 observations and 15 columns left in the new dataset.


# Discovery from explored data
- The history behind violence in countries, is that the citizen ends up suffering the most.
- Some countries in west Africa are Mali, Nigeria, Niger, Guinea, Liberia, Senegal, Mauritania, Ghana, Ivory Coast, Sierra Leone, Togo and Cape Verde 
- Between the four years (2019 -2022), 2020 was the worst for violence in west Africa (refer to bar chat). I agree with this because the endsars movement took place in 2020 in Nigeria.
- The dataset had a total of 19579 rows of data for each column and there were 31 columns.
- Most of the column types were character.
- The biggest event was violence against the citizens in west Africa and it is mainly caused by military personnel’s, police etc basically people in power.
- Nigeria has the highest occurrence of these events.


# Visualisation
These are the visualisations I produced to from the using the dataset:
